ideas:

decay --> oracle 
--> need to be able to create own oracles  

Incentive --> 
--> also can incentivize larger deposits , also oracle possibility. 

Destruction date 
    --> make it so after a date, contract can be called to self destruct
        --> contract will send all ETH to certain address (I may own it)
        --> and also clean up the ERC20s it created.
